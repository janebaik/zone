## Overview

# Background info
* Zone is a unique weather app that is visually appealing for users. This app will consist of: a continuous scrolling of a single-page, search bars for the weather, time around different worlds, and a diagram of upcoming forecast. This project will have the basic functionality of telling users their weather (degree, cloud condition) based on the current time and location of the user, but a complex frontend design.


# Functionality & MVP for more details
1. `Telling users their weather (degree, cloud condition)` based on the current time and location of the user
2. `Continuous scrolling effect`. As the user scrolls, the background will fade from day and night. The app can go up to a week in advance. The background will also change depending on the time 
3. `User will be able to search for different timezones`. A user can also save temporarily that timezone. 
4. `User will be able to search for different weather conditions` all over the world 


## Zone was built with:
